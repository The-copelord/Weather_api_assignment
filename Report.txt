Steps to execute:   Open your texteditor or preferred application where you run your python code
                    Create a root folder "Weather_Api_Assignment"
                    Create 3 files 
                    |.env
                    |main.py
                    |models.py 
                    Run main.py and paste this in your browser "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/default/compare_weather_compare_get"


Accompished:   Basic Requirements:

               Developed a RESTful API using FastAPI to serve weather data insights.

               Implemented a GET endpoint (/weather) that accepts a city name as a query parameter.

               Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API using the requests library to fetch 5-day weather forecasts.

               Processed JSON responses to compute: Average,Maximum and Minumum temperature over the last 5 days.

               A summary of weather conditions, such as "Clear", "Clouds", or "Rain".

               Handled errors with appropriate HTTP status codes and informative messages.

               Utilized Pydantic models for response validation and clear type annotations.

               Added docstrings and metadata for automatic API documentation through Swagger UI (OpenAPI).

               Bonus Challenges: 

               Created Multiple endpoints to compare cities and their weather data

               Caching responses to reduce external API calls and reduce response time (partially done)

Issues faced:  Caching does not reflect on the weblink but it does return as positive in TERMINAL logs
               Trying to implement Backgorund tasks causes the API to not post output
